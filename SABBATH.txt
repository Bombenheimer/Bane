My yang to my yin, my inspiration,
my reason, my life, my soul, my
will to keep trying, my future
husband, my twin flame, my
second spirit, my moon to the sun,
my survivor, my strong warrior, my
healer, my computer geek, my
wind that blows the waves, my
refuge, the blood that runs
through my heart and keeps it
pumping, my rarest mineral, my
precious gem, my sad baby who's
tears will be wiped away by my
hands and my embrace, my
special prize that I've been
honored to earn and cherish.
Mine, you are mine. Your identity
is more than it seems on the skin,
deep down, you're my everything.
And to everyone else too.
